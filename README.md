#Bad Events to Good Epochs

BEtGE is a MNE based framework developed by two EPITA (Ecole Pour l'Informatique et les Techniques Avanc√©es) students for our end of studies project.  
In collaboration with iCrin work on OCD through EEG analysis, BEtGE offers to parse events extracted from a file and eliminates any false positive for ulterior processing.  

Designed on iCrin experiments (called Lucifer - Symmetry - 7 Diffs and Toki), BEtGE is a simple tool making sure that no artefacts remain among the events previously recorded, and returns created epochs already preprocessed.

## Installation
Build from source

```bash
python3 -m build .
```

Install
(preferably inside a virtual environment such as venv, conda, etc..)

```bash
python3 -m pip install dist/betge-x.x.x-py3-none-any.whl
```

## Usage
```python
from betge.betge import *

symmetry = "Neuroscans_OCD_metacognition/sub-044_task-symmetry.cnt"
epochs_sym = betge_symmetry(symmetry)

lucifer = "Neuroscans_OCD_metacognition/sub-042_task-lucifer.cnt"
epochs_luc = betge_lucifer(lucifer)
```
